const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "this is where you determine what youre going to need and plan accordingly"
const design = "this is where you decide what structure to use and how you want to wtite the code"
const implement = "this is where you write all the code how you want"
const testing = "this is where you test all the code and see if you can break it/ if its complete"
const maintain = "this is where you take your finished product and make sure it stays up to date and watch it for future bugs"
